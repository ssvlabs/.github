At [SSV Labs](https://ssvlabs.io/) we’re building the **foundation for a truly decentralized Ethereum**. Our globally-distributed team of developers, researchers, and Ethereum enthusiasts is pushing the boundaries of **Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)** to unlock the next generation of secure, permissionless re/staking.

## DVT x  ETH

We incubate many open-source projects, here's a few that deserve the spotlight:

* **[ssv](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv)** – the reference Go implementation of _Secret-Shared Validator_ (SSV), enabling operators to run validators collaboratively while remaining trust-minimized.
* **[based-applications](https://github.com/ssvlabs/based-applications)** – everything related to Based Applications and their respective smart-contracts.
* **[ssv-contracts](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv-contracts)** – the Solidity smart-contract that power the SSV network network.
* **[ssv-stack](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv-stack)** – a collection of tools and services that help you get started with SSV network.
* **[ssv-specs](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv-specs)** – the specifications for SSV network.
* **[ssv-sdk](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv-sdk)** – the SDK is a TypeScript library for interacting with the SSV network, enabling distributed validator operations on Ethereum.
* **[gitbook-docs](https://github.com/ssvlabs/gitbook-docs)** – the documentation for SSV.
